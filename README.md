Pandas Homework
Please find my code file, HerosOfPymoli.ipynb in the HerosOfPymoli folder.

To answer the final questions of the homework, the 3 trends I noted from the Heros of Pymoli data are:
1. Most of the players are male (84%), however female players spend more then male players on average ($4.47 vs $4.07)
2. There are some very young players registered (<10 years), no players over 46 years, and players aged in their early 20s make up the largest player group (45%).
3. The top 5 most popular games are, unsurprisingly, the top 5 most profitable games for the company.  However, not in the same ranking, as although 'Extraction, Quickblade Of Trembling Hands' is more popular than 'Final Critic', the later is more profitable.
