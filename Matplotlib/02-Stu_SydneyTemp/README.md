# Sydney Weather

* In this activity you will visualize the differences between temperature recorded in degrees Celsius versus degrees Fahrenheit.

## Instructions

* Using the following data, plot the monthly averages for temperature in Sydney in both degrees Celsius and degrees Fahrenheit.

  * Average temperature per month in Celsius: 3.92, 5.6, 10.64, 16.8, 22.4, 28.0, 30.24, 29.12, 25.2, 18.48, 12.88, 6.72]

* Assign to the x-axis a range of numerical values representing each month of the year.

* Plot the degrees Celsius points.

* Use a list comprehension to convert the temperature to degrees Celsius.

  * The formula for conversion is: F = (C/0.56) + 32. Where F is degrees Fahrenheit and C is degrees Celsius.

* Plot the degrees Fahrenheit points.

* Create a third plot with both the degrees Fahrenheit and degrees Celsius points.

**Hint**:

* See the [Matplotlib documentation](https://matplotlib.org/2.0.2/index.html) for more information regarding the Pyplot library.

* Also look into the [NumPy documentation](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/) for more information on the NumPy library.
