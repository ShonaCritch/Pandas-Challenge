# Average Rainfall

## Instructions

* Look at the [raw data](Resources/avg_rain_aus.csv) in your resources folder. This dataset contains the average rainfall for each major city in any given year.

* Using the [starter file](Unsolved/avg_rain.ipynb), generate a plot that shows the average rainfall per state.

## Hints

* Think critically about the different plots we discussed today. Ask yourself which type of plot summarizes the data most effectively.

* Be sure to add a title, axis labels, and any other aesthetic elements that may help make the visualization more effective.
